# AI Skill Navigator

AI Skill Navigator is a Moodle plugin suite that adds course-aware AI learning tools for students and teachers.

The package contains:

- `local_aiskillnavigator`: the main local plugin with AI tutor, quiz generation, mind maps, assessments, material/RAG tools, learning-gap analysis, simulator suggestions and course-building helpers.
- `block_aiskillnavigator`: an optional course block that links users to the tools available for their role.

## Production defaults

The plugin is designed to install safely with conservative defaults:

- The default AI provider is `prototype`, which performs no external AI calls.
- External AI use for course materials is disabled until an administrator enables it.
- Per-material approval is required before teacher materials can be sent to external providers.
- Destructive AI Course Builder actions are disabled by default.
- Automatic course-resource synchronisation on Moodle events is disabled by default.
- Automatic block insertion into courses is disabled by default.
- External MathJax CDN loading is disabled by default.

Administrators can enable optional external services from the plugin settings.

## Main features

- Course-aware AI Tutor.
- AI Quiz Generator.
- AI Mind Map Generator.
- Initial and final assessments.
- Adaptive review for weak skills.

```

Then visit:

## Configuration

```

Important production settings:

- `Provider`: keep `prototype` for first installation checks.

## Privacy

The plugin stores course materials, quiz attempts, assessment attempts, saved simulations and tutor interaction signals. It implements Moodle's Privacy API for metadata, export and deletion of user data. External AI providers are optional and disabled for course materials unless explicitly approved.

## Moodle Marketplace package

The Moodle Marketplace package for this component contains only `local_aiskillnavigator` and installs as `local/aiskillnavigator`.

The optional `block_aiskillnavigator` is a separate Moodle component. It is not bundled in the local-plugin Marketplace ZIP and, when distributed through Moodle Marketplace, must be released separately with its dependency on `local_aiskillnavigator` declared.

Marketplace releases are checked with the repository's dedicated Moodle Plugin CI workflow before packaging.

## Requirements

- Moodle 4.4 or later.
- PHP version supported by the target Moodle version.
- Optional cURL support for external AI/search providers.

## License

GPL v3 or later.
